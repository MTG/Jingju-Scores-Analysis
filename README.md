# Jingju Scores Analysis

This is a collection of tools for automatically extracting statistical and quantitative information from the [**Jingju Music Scores Collection**](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1285612) (**JMSC**). The information can be restricted to any combination of the four elements of the jingju musical system, namely role type, *shengqiang*, *banshi* and line type.

## Content

The **Jingju-Singing-Analysis** folder contains code for extracting statistical and quantitative information about singing lines from arias of the **JMSC**. This information is returned in the form of tables and plots.

The **Jingju-Tones-Analysis** folder contains code for analysing the relationship between linguistic tones and melody in singing lines from arias of the **JMSC**, considering the two main relationship types, namely syllabic contour and pairwise relationship.

Detailed description of each code and instructions about how to use them are available in the README files in each folder.
